# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is EcmaScript?

- EcmaScript is the standard on which JavaScript is based.
- EcmaScript and JavaScript are the same and are often used interchangeably.
- JavaScript is very flexible and liberal in its usage.

## How do I Execute JavaScript?

There are multiple ways to execute JavaScript:

1. **In Your Browser:**
   - You can execute JavaScript directly in your browser.
   - Right-click on the browser (e.g., Chrome), select **Inspect**, and then navigate to the **Console** tab.

2. **Using a Runtime Environment (e.g., Node.js):**
   - Install Node.js on your machine.
   - Create a `.js` file and run it using the following command:
   
     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```

3. **Embedding JavaScript in an HTML Document:**
   - You can embed JavaScript within an HTML document using the `<script>` tag:
   
     ```html
     <script>
       // Your JavaScript code here
     </script>
     ```

## Who Created the JavaScript Runtime (Node.js)?

Ryan Dahl created the JavaScript runtime, Node.js, by embedding the V8 engine of the Chrome browser into a C++ program. This allows JavaScript to be used outside of the browser environment.
